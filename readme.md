# freethrow game calculator

this is a repo I build purely out of my curiosity

## Rules

There are many variations of this game, but there are two popular variations

1. turn-based, player takes to shoot until one of them, the winner, reach the goal.
2. 1 turn, one player shoot until he reaches the goal, then another player. Whoever
   use the fewer shots win.

## Purpose

This tool is used for calcuating the probability of one player to win over the other.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Install numpy
3. run the variation user wants

### Arguments

the code must be given these 3 arguments.

- first one is a scoring probability of first player "a"
- the second is that of "b"
- the third is how scoring goal of this game.

\*\* (optional) The last argument is number of simulations.
